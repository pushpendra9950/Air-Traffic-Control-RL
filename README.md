# Air-Traffic-Control-RL
# What did we do?
 We Simulated an aircraft Traffic Control agent which maneuvers around other planes to reach a common destination. Had to modify a PyGame based game to make it using MDP and formualted the states, actions and rewards and  we trained the agent using the SARSA algorithm.
